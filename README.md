# 99-scala-problems
This is another take on 99 Scala Problems. However, the purpose of this is not to show how good I am solving them, but offering a way to beginners to practice and write their own solutions. This project will contain tests and the public interfaces of each problem, so anybody is free to implement solutions in their own way!
